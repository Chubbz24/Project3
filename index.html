      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Persona aims to connect people locally and globally around the world by letting them know who is near them and whether you can answer their queries/questions or if you are wanting to chat. Communicating without interacting. </p>

       <p> Walking down the street and you walk by someone who is currently needing help with certain things, you could send that person some advice or a quick message or answer a question that they have posted on their wall of their page without actually meeting them. The person receiving these messages or answers can see who it came from, and they can rate that person out of 5. The higher your rating the more recognition you will get from people. </p>

      <p>  Persona is here to help people on the go and to also help recognise those with talent and skill by being able to share what they know and what they have on the go.  </p>
